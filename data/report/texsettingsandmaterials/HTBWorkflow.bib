In exploratory data analysis, this involves iterative training and analysis using original and learned annotations and task-associated representations. anndata offers a canonical data structure for book-keeping these, which is neither addressed by pandas (McKinney, 2010), nor xarray (Hoyer \&amp; Hamman, 2017), nor commonly-used modeling packages like scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011).Competing Interest StatementF.J.T. consults for Immunai Inc., Singularity Bio B.V., CytoReason Ltd, and Omniscope Ltd, and has ownership interest in Cellarity Inc. and Dermagnostix GmbH.
